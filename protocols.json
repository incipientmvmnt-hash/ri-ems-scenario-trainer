    "content": "1. Respond to the scene in a safe manner:\n\u2022 Use information available from the dispatcher, including 911 EMD nature and priority information, consider scene safety and pre-arrival assessment and treatment of the patient.\n\u2022 Request appropriate additional resources, including advanced life support (ALS) response / intercept if available and the patient may benefit from\nALS care.\n\u2022 Use of emergency warning lights and sirens should be used with discretion and only as appropriate for the nature of the response and given information, including 911 EMD priority information.\n2. Approach the scene cautiously and assess scene safety:\n\u2022 If a hazard is identified, request appropriate assistance and maintain scene safety through appropriate measures including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as indicated. If the scene is unsafe, stage until hazards / threats are mitigated.\n\u2022 Use standard precautions for all patient contacts. Standard precautions include, depending on the anticipated degree or exposure, the use of gloves, gowns, mask, and eye protection or a face shield. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after each patient contact. Institute transmission based precautions as indicated in Table 1 below.\n\u2022 Bring all necessary equipment to the patient.\n3. Utilize the Major Incident Protocol, if indicated based the number of patients and/or need for resources.\n4. Determine if the patient(s) meet pediatric or adult criteria by age. A pediatric ti patient is defined as a patient less than 16 years of age. For patients \u2264\nE kg/80 lbs., use a pediatric dosing device (Broselow Handtevy or other). If the Broselow Pediatric Emergency Resuscitation Tape is used, patients taller than the length of the tape should receive weight based medication dosing ti until the age of 16 years old or their total body weight is \u226550kg. Some special needs patients may require continued use of pediatric protocols regardless of age.\n5. For trauma patients, evaluate the mechanism of injury (MOI) and employ spinal precautions (if indicated, follow the Spinal Precautions Protocol).\n6. Obtain and document the patient\u2019s chief complaint (CC), history of the present illness (HPI), past medical history (PMH), current medications\n(including over-the-counter medications) and allergies to medications.\n7. Perform a primary assessment and obtain vital signs. Vital signs shall include at least blood pressure (BP), palpated pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation as measured by oximeter (SpO ). Temperature (oral, rectal, axillary, or esophageal probe) should be obtained and documented when available and in all critically ill or injured patients.\n8. Perform a secondary assessment. The secondary assessment may consist of focused examination for isolated injuries.\n9. Treat life-threatening conditions, in the order in which they are identified.\nManage all conditions as indicated per the age appropriate protocols.\n10. All patients shall have their level of pain assessed and documented using an age appropriate pain scale (see age appropriate Patient Comfort Protocol).\n11. Pain, nausea and vomiting should be managed following age appropriate\nPatient Comfort Protocols.\n12. Provide airway management when indicated following age appropriate\nAirway Management Protocols. All patients with an advanced airway (BIAD,\nETT, etc.), including interfacility transfer patients, must have the airway monitored with quantitative waveform capnography and documented in the\nPCR.\n13. For patients with dyspnea, chest pain, weakness, abdominal pain or other symptoms of possible cardiac etiology and/or with a SpO of <94%, oxygen should be administered via appropriate delivery device to maintain the SpO in a range of 94-99%. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) oxygen should be administered at the highest FiO possible. Once return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, the FiO should be titrated to the lowest concentration required to maintain the SpO in a range of 94-99%.\n14. Advanced life support (ALS) EMS healthcare professionals may establish intravenous (IV) access in any unstable or potentially unstable patient or when required for protocol directed therapeutic intervention (e.g., analgesia, treatment of nausea or vomiting, etc.). 0.9% saline solution is the fluid of choice for \u201ckeep vein open\u201d (KVO) purposes and limited fluid boluses. Unless otherwise directed by protocol, Lactated Ringer\u2019s is the fluid of choice for significant fluid resuscitation for shock and burn injury. The KVO rate for adult patients is 20-30 ml/hour and for pediatric patients 10-20 ml/hr. Flow rates should be adjusted as directed by protocol. When appropriate, an r intermittent needle therapy (INT) device (a.k.a. saline lock) may be placed in lieu of an infusing IV. Intraosseous (IO) access is these protocols and standing t orders interchangeable with IV access and reference to the IV route of ti medication administration is inclusive of the IO route.\n15. Pediatric maintenance IV fluids should be calculated as follows: 4ml/kg for the\nE first 10 kg + 2 ml for the second 10 kg plus 1 ml for each additional kg.\nti\n16. All intravenous medication and electrolyte infusions, unless exempted in\nAppendix 09.01 , must be administered via an electronic infusion pump. See\nAppendix 09.01 for Standard Concentrations for IV Admixtures.\n17. A multi-lead ECG (\u226512 lead) should be obtained in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia/infarction (chest pain or discomfort, known or suspected anginal equivalent, weakness, abdominal pain, etc.) and in all patients post medical cardiac arrest with ROSC.\n18. All procedures, regardless of success, shall be documented on the patient care report (PCR). Documentation shall include, at a minimum: the procedure, the device used, anatomic location, number of attempts, healthcare professional performing the procedure, and any noted complications.\n19. Communicate with MEDICAL CONTROL, as indicated, and/or to provide entry .\nnotification to the receiving hospital facility. EMS healthcare professionals may consult directly with a MEDICAL CONTROL physician any time they feel such communication may be helpful in the care of a patient. Entry notification to the receiving hospital facility shall occur via electronic communication utilizing the RI Patient Tracking System (PTS). It may also occur via direct voice contact utilizing telephonic or radio communication.\n20. Transport the patient to the nearest appropriate Hospital Emergency Facility\n(see Table 2 - Point of Entry - Specialized Hospital Emergency Facilities).\nPatients in respiratory or cardiac arrest should be transported to the nearest Hospital Emergency Facility unless otherwise directed by MEDICAL CONTROL.\nEMS healthcare professionals should recognize and consider, that absent an acute life threatening condition or a condition requiring transportation to specialized care facility, the most appropriate transport destination may be facility at which the patient is followed or receives care (this facility may not be the nearest geographically).\n21. Some patients who are older than the pediatric age limit with chronic medical conditions may request or require transportation to a Pediatric Specialty Care Facility. Contact Medical Control at the facility to discuss destination options.\n22. During patient transport:\n\u2022 Stretcher patients shall be secured in an appropriate restraint system providing both transverse and longitudinal protection. Straps are required at the patient\u2019s knees, hips, and over the shoulders.\n\u2022 Ambulance cots shall be positioned at the lowest possible position during patient transport and other movement of the patient.\n\u2022 Seated patients shall be restrained with a lap and chest safety belt restraining system.\n\u2022 Patient transport is limited to one patient per ambulance, unless situation meets the Major Incident Protocol criteria.\n\u2022 Pediatric patients of appropriate age, height or weight shall be transported utilizing a restraint system (child safety seat) compliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The car safety seat shall be properly affixed to a stretcher with the head section elevated or to vehicle seat, unless the patient requires immobilization of the spinal column, pelvis, or lower extremities; or the patient requires resuscitation or management of a critical problem.\n\u2022 All heavy items and equipment (e.g., cardiac monitors, oxygen cylinders) in the patient care compartment of the ambulance shall be secured following the manufactures specifications.\nti\n\u2022 Emergency warning lights and sirens should only be used when transporting patients with acute life threatening conditions requiring time sensitive interventions.\nE 23. The following may be used as a reference for pediatric age appropriate systolic ti\nblood pressure:\nNeonate >60 mmHg Infant to 1 year >70 mmHg\n1-10 years >70 + (2 x age in years)\n>10 years >90 mmHg\n24. A face-to-face verbal report (hand-off) detailing the patient\u2019s chief complaint, abnormal assessment findings, EMS interventions, and the patient\u2019s response to treatment shall be given to a licensed healthcare professional (i.e., RN,\nAPRN, PA, MD, DO) at the receiving facility.\n25. All care shall be documented in accordance with the Documentation Protocol on a PCR.\n26. Direct patient care provided by a non-transporting RI licensed ambulance (i.e., fire suppression unit, ALS intercept, etc.) must be documented by the completion of a PCR by a licensed EMS healthcare professional staffing the unit and providing care. This may result in the generation of two PCRs within one service for the same patient/incident.\nTable 1 - Transmission Based Precautions\nCategory Category Components Clinical Applicability\nContact Standard precautions + use of Norovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, gloves during patient contact Clostridioides difficile, acute diarrhea and when touching the patient\u2019s of unknown etiology, respiratory immediate environment or syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, belongings, changing of gowns multidrug resistant organisms (MRSA, and gloves after every patient VRE, ESBLs, VISA/VRSA), scabies/head contact, cleaning and disinfecting lice, herpes zoster (shingles) with all surfaces and reusable disseminated disease, varicella equipment, and strict hand (chickenpox), herpes simplex virus washing.

All patient contacts with a RI licensed ambulance service must be documented.\n2. All documentation must be performed electronically utilizing a National\nEmergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) compliant software platform. The version will be determined by the Center for EMS.\n3. The use of paper documentation is only acceptable in the event of electronic documentation failure. Paper documentation may not be used as\n\u201cplaceholder\u201d for electronic documentation.\n4. Receiving facilities shall be provided a completed copy of the patient care report (PCR) proximate to patient arrival. In the event this is not possible, the\nPCR will be completed and provided to the receiving facility as soon as possible and no greater than two (2) hours after patient hand-off. An explanation in the narrative section of the PCR should explain any delay in the ti provision of a PCR to a receiving facility and should indicate the means used to deliver the report and confirm that it was received.\n5. PCR data shall be transmitted or otherwise provided to the Center of\nEmergency Medical Services (CEMS) in the timeframe specified in the Rhode Island Code of Regulations, Emergency Medical Services [216-RICR-20-10-2].\n6.

Medication administration documentation shall include the name of the medication, dose administered, route, time of administration, name of the administering healthcare professional, medication effect, and any adverse effects.\n9. At least two complete sets of vital signs shall be documented for transported patients and one complete set for non-transported patients (pulse, respirations, auscultated blood pressure, and the SpO at a minimum). Vital signs should be repeated and documented after drug administration, prior to patient transfer, and as needed during transport. For patients <3 y. o., blood pressure measurement is not required for all patients, but should be measured if possible, especially in critically ill patients, for whom blood pressure measurement may guide treatment decisions. For critically ill or injured patients, vital signs should be documented at least every ten minutes and whenever significant changes are noted. The use of \u201cWNL\u201d is inappropriate and should not be utilized as a substitute for the documentation of measured vital signs.\n10. ECG and EtCO tracings must be uploaded into the PCR.\n11.

    "content": "Introduction\n\u2022 Emergency Medical Services healthcare professionals have traditionally functioned as mobile healthcare unit and are a logical resource for providing healthcare to the community as an extension of the primary care and public health network, provided a formal process is followed, as outlined in this protocol.\n\u2022 This protocol enables an EMS agency to form a coalition of partners for the purpose of providing community-based health care services within the scope of practice of the EMS healthcare professional.\n\u2022 A community that is experiencing a gap in healthcare services, as evidenced by a community needs assessment, may elect to utilize the capabilities of the EMS system in collaboration with public health, primary care healthcare professionals and/or a hospital. i\n\u2022 Only EMS agencies who have met the requirements of this protocol may operate under i these guidelines. Health is available to provide consultation and support to Mobile Integrated Healthcare -\nCommunity Paramedicine initiatives.\nDescription of Mobile Integrated Healthcare (MIH) - Community Paramedicine (CP)\n\u2022 MIH-CP is the provision of healthcare using patient-centered mobile resources in the out-of- hospital environment.\n\u2022 The MIH-CP concept is envisioned to be an organized system of services, based on local\n/ need.\n\u2022 The purpose of the initiative is to address the unmet needs of individuals who are experiencing intermittent health care issues. It is not intended to address long-term medical or nursing case management and is not a replacement for traditional home health services. MIH-CP Licensing Requirements\n\u2022 EMS agencies wishing to provide MIH-CP services must be a licensed emergency medical services agency pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws \u00a723-4.1 and the Rhode Island Code of t Regulations, Emergency Medical Services [216-RICR-20-10-2]. r\n\u2022 The services must be provided by an Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), Advanced EMTs,\nAdvanced EMT-Cardiacs or Paramedics who are integrated into the local health care system, working in a collaborative manner with physicians, mid-level healthcare professionals, home health care agencies and other community health colleagues, within their respective scope l of practice.\n\u2022 EMS healthcare professionals shall perform services within their scope of practice.\n\u2022 Oversight all activities must be provided by emergency and primary care physicians. Goal of the MIH-CP program\n\u2022 Provide urgent follow-up care when other home health resources and services are not an option.\n\u2022 Be part of a multidisciplinary team evaluating the needs of individuals who frequently utilize\nEMS in order to reduce that frequency while improving the quality and effectiveness of care delivered.\n\u2022 Assess patients not recently seen by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) or physician assistant (PA) for the need for chronic disease screening, and in collaboration . with a primary care practice, help to initiate that screening.\n\u2022 Or, other goal(s) as approved by the Center for EMS.\nAssessing Community Needs\n\u2022 EMS agencies are encouraged to work with their communities to assess their needs and en- sure the MIH-CP program goals align. MIH-CP is intended as a means to utilize EMS re- sources to address community healthcare needs. It is understood that the mix and delivery method of MIH-CP services will vary from community to community, as needs vary.\n\u2022 A fundamental element of establishing a MIH-CP program, therefore, is that the EMS agen- cy assess what the unaddressed or under-addressed health needs of their community might be. It is only then that the agency can determine whether it has the staff, finances, and oth- er resources to address some of those needs.\nEligibility of MIH-CP Patient\n\u2022 EMS agencies establishing an MIH-CP program are encouraged to develop their own eligibil- ity criteria based on the scope of their MIH-CP program.\n\u2022 Patient must be enrolled in the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) (CurrentCare or other HIE designated by the Director). If a patient is not enrolled, EMS agencies can encourage patient to enroll in the HIE as part of the MIH-CP enrollment pro- cess.\n\u2022 Patient must not be eligible for home nursing care or home care services unless referred by a PCP (e.g., pending initiation of home health services). MIH-CP Program Scope\n/\nThe roles within the scope of MIH-CP shall include the following, but not limited to:\n\u2022 Assessments within the scope of practice of the MIH-CP practitioner, as ordered by the cli- ent's PCP or as established within the approved MIH-CP program.\n\u2022 Screening and education for chronic disease as well as mental and behavioral health in pa- tients who are home bound when other resources are not available or have failed; l\n\u2022 PARAMEDICS and AEMT-C only: administration of immunizations and vaccinations for cli- ents in the home (e.g., seasonal influenza and COVID vaccines), in accordance with the Immunization Protocol, or where the vaccine is provided by a primary care practice, trans- ported appropriately, and the EMS agency is enrolled in the RIDOH State Supplied Vaccine (SSV) program.\n\u2022 Urgent laboratory specimen collection (i.e., blood draws and cultures), as requested by the primary care practice;\n\u2022 Public health functions, such as evaluation of patients enrolled in a direct active monitoring or direct observed therapy program prescribed by RIDOH or evaluation of patients based on approved MIH-CP program.\n\u2022 By protocol and after real time consultation with a primary care practice healthcare profes- sional, EMS medical director or approved MIH-CP patient interaction plan, provide on-scene treatment without transportation; and\n\u2022 Home safety assessments, including prevention of falls and fire safety. Referral Process of MIH-CP\n\u2022 EMS initiated: as a result of frequent EMS calls from specific patients with approval from the\nPCP or as established within the approved MIH-CP program. To make a referral, the EMS agency shall contact the patient\u2019s PCP or case manager to suggest the referral, if applicable.\nOtherwise, the patient should be enrolled as established within the approved MIH-CP program.\n\u2022 Emergency department (ED) initiated: referral from emergency department (ED) physician upon discharge, provided that a memorandum of understanding is already in place with that emergency department and a primary care practice with an MOU is included in the follow-up plan at the time of the referral.\n\u2022 Primary care professional (PCP) initiated: the patient requires urgent assessment based on phone assessment by the primary care practice, the patient does not currently have access to or is ineligible for home nursing care or home care services, and requires frequent needs that i can be addressed in the community via MIH-CP, or the patient requires follow-up assessment i and care that can be fulfilled through MIH-CP.\n\u2022 Other programs: referral from a home nursing care healthcare professional or home care healthcare professional as a result of ineligibility for these services.\n\u2022 RI Department of Health (RIDOH): referral for public health functions. Field Treatment Without Transportation\n\u2022 EMS healthcare professionals, in direct consultation with the patient\u2019s PCP, EMS Medical Director or approved MIH-CP patient interaction plan are allowed to administer field treatment without transportation of the patient to a hospital facility.\n\u2022 The PCP shall provide on-line medical control to the EMS healthcare professional to authorize\n/ field treatment, provided said treatment is within the scope of practice of the on-scene EMS healthcare professional and is consistent with the Rhode Island Statewide EMS Protocols and Standing Orders.\nTransportation to a non-hospital facility\nA patient may be transported to a non-hospital facility, including a health clinic, primary care\noffice, urgent care facility or substance abuse treatment center only when:\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s PCP provides authorization via direct consultation, or;\n\u2022 Certain clinical criteria have been met, particularly for transportation to a substance abuse treatment center, or;\n\u2022 Authorization is provided by medical control, or;\n\u2022 As approved in MIH-CP patient interaction plan.\nEstablishing Medical Direction\n\u2022 The MIH-CP program must establish a collaborative working relationship between the EMS Medical Director or designee, who will be responsible for medical policy, operations and continuous quality improvement, and medical direction for MIH-CP services.\n\u2022 The leadership role of the primary care healthcare professional in every patient-EMS healthcare professional interaction plays a pivotal role in the design of MIH-CP and is requirement for MIH-CP programs in which services require primary care interaction. Developing a Training Plan\n\u2022 EMS agencies are encouraged to develop MIH-CP training that can aid EMS healthcare professionals to be more effective in their communities. EMS healthcare professionals will benefit from training that includes cultural competency, health literacy, behavioral health, community awareness, home health care, MIH-CP education and specific program topic education.\n\u2022 EMS agencies shall designate who will be responsible for training, oversight, and coordination as well as their qualifications.\n\u2022 There must be a continuing education and credentialing process in place, with documentation of each EMS healthcare professional\u2019s participation.\n\u2022 Such a process shall be approved by the EMS service Medical Director(s) and shall be reported to the Center for EMS Training Coordinator.\nContinuous Quality Improvement Program /\n\u2022 The EMS service shall implement a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program specifically for the MIH-CP program that incorporates all the components of an EMS CQI program as specified in the Rhode Island Code of Regulations, Emergency Medical Services [216-RICR-20- 10-2]. Data Collection Data collection is a critical component of a quality MIH-CP program. EMS agencies shall follow minimum standards for data collection in accordance with sections within the Routine Patient\nCare and Documentation. In addition, provide answers to the following: t\n\u2022 Describe what data demonstrates the need for this project, if any.\n\u2022 Describe your agency\u2019s ability to collect the following required data: age, race/ethnicity, gender.\n\u2022 Describe other data to be collected to demonstrate the impact of this project on the population served.\n\u2022 Describe the data reporting plan and how the RI Center for EMS will receive data and reports.\n\u2022 EMS agencies should also be equipped and prepared to report on data involving the number of participants enrolled, number of participants active in the program, number of participants treated for MIH-CP enrollment vs. transported for emergency need, plus any other data that RI DOH deems necessary. Documentation\n\u2022 The EMS agency will participate in electronic data collection as required in the Rhode Island\nCode of Regulations, Emergency Medical Services [216-RICR-20-10-2].\n\u2022 Electronic patient care reports of all MIH-CP program patient encounters must be submitted . via the MIH-CP module in RI-EMSIS.\n\u2022 If, using their own discretion, a EMS healthcare professional decides to activate the E-911 system for emergency treatment and transport for appropriate care, a patient care report must be submitted via the RI-EMSIS. Requirements to establish a MIH-CP program in Rhode Island\nEach EMS service that wants to establish an MIH-CP program must submit a plan to the RI Center for EMS MIH-CP coordinator via an online application. The plan should include the following\nelements (application may have additional requirements):\n1. General Project Description\n\u2022 Describe the community or communities to be served, the name of the MIH-CP program (e.g., South County MIH-CP), the service\u2019s base location(s), the unmet community health needs that will be addressed, the current community health team collaborators and methodology for addressing the need, including any enhancements of the EMS response system that will result.\n2. Medical Direction\n\u2022 Provide information related to a collaborative working relationship between the EMS agency and the EMS medical director, including the role of the medical director in the MIH-CP / program.\n3. Patient Interaction Plan\n\u2022 Describe the nature of anticipated patient and EMS healthcare professional interaction.\n\u2022 Specify how the patient community will be educated to have realistic expectations of the EMS practitioner and their interactions.\n\u2022 Establish community patient needs, and goals and objectives to meet those needs.\n4. Staffing Plan\n\u2022 Describe who will be providing MIH-CP services and how these services fit within the normal\nEMS staffing of the service.\n\u2022 Describe the type of schedule MIH-CP services will be made available to the community.\n\u2022 Describe how staffing arrangements will be funded.\n5. Training and Education Plan\n\u2022 Describe what training and education will be provided to enable EMS healthcare professionals to deliver the services described above.\n\u2022 List the objectives and outcomes of the training and education plan.\n\u2022 Document who will be responsible for training, education, oversight, and coordination, as well as their qualifications.\n6. Continuous Quality Improvement Program\n\u2022 Establish a continuous quality improvement program led by the medical director.\n7. Data Collection\n\u2022 Describe what data demonstrates the need for this project, if any.\n\u2022 Describe the data to be collected to demonstrate the impact of this project on the population served. Documentation\n\u2022 Describe the documentation process for the MIH-CP program.\nCoordinating Care and MIH-CP\n\u2022 Describe how care will be coordinated with patients enrolled in MIH-CP program. Referral Process & Eligibility\n\u2022 Identify the MIH-CP program referral process.\n\u2022 Describe the eligibility criteria for patients participating in your agency MIH-CP program.\n/\nNOTES:\n\u2022 At no time are EMS healthcare professionals allowed to perform activities not included in the skill level of their scope of practice. MIH-CP functions expand the role of EMS healthcare professionals, not the scope of practice.\n\u2022 If at any time there is any doubt as to whether the patient needs care at a hospital-based emergency department or not, immediate transportation shall be provided to an appropriate hospital emergency facility.\n\u2022 Communities participating in the MIH-CP program are also strongly encouraged to be leaders and participants in improving community-based care, e.g., the HeartSafe .\nCommunity program, opioid overdose prevention and blood pressure screenings, and partnering with primary care to coordinate MIH-CP services."

The use of antihistamines, corti- costeroids and epinephrine offer no benefit in ACE-I related angioedema.\n\u2022 The use of an auto-injector is strongly recommended for the administration of IM epi- nephrine at all EMS healthcare professional levels, if available.\n\u2022 For patients <15 kg (33 lbs.) with moderate or severe symptoms, paramedics may consider epinephrine (1:1000) 0.01 mg/kg IM.\n\u2022 If possible, patients with severe symptoms should remain in a supine position.\n\u2022 Allergic reactions may occur with only respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms without rash or other skin symptoms/signs.\n\u2022 Patients with moderate or severe reactions should have IV access established and cardiac monitoring initiated.\n\u2022 Tachycardia (HR >150) is common following administration of epinephrine and/or albut- erol. These patients should have ongoing cardiac monitoring and should have a multi-lead\nECG acquired following the administration of epinephrine.\n\u2022 Do not withhold epinephrine in a normal healthy child.\n\u2022 Epinephrine is the single most effective drug to reverse immediate moderate and sever symptoms and should be the first drug administered.\n\u2022 Diphenhydramine helps rash and itch, steroids take time for effects to be seen.\n\u2022 ACE-I induced angioedema usually starts with focal swelling (e.g. isolated swelling of the tongue or lips). Patients with severe angioedema involving the tongue with airway compro- mise often require nasotracheal intubation.\n\u2022 In the case of hereditary angioedema (HAE), like ACE-I related angioedema, the use of anti- histamines, corticosteroids and epinephrine offer no benefit. Some patients with HAE are prescribed medication which may reverse it. Paramedics may assist the patient with or ad- minister these medication per patient or packaging/prescription instructions."

The management of bronchiolitis is largely supportive.\n)\n\u2022 Nebulized epinephrine is typically not recommended in bronchiolitis unless the patient is in extremis.

It is usually of rapid onset, associated with fever and drooling. Stridor may be present and the patient may\n( assume the tripod position. Airway manipulation may worsen the condition and should be avoided. The incidence of epiglottis has decreased over the last couple of decades due to routine immunization against Haemophilus influenzae.\n\u2022 A \u201csilent chest\u201d in the asthmatic patient is a pre-respiratory arrest indicator.\n\u2022 When considering endotracheal intubation in the asthmatic patient, if possible, administer a rapid 20 ml/kg IV bolus of NS or LR prior to intubation.\n\u2022 Asthmatics are prone to hypotension following conversion to positive pressure ventilation (endotracheal intubation) due to decreased cardiac return (preload). Address volume status prior to intubation, following intubation ventilate the patient at a lower rate and utilize lower tidal volumes. Hypercapnia, as evidenced by increased EtCO levels is acceptable and attempts to correct with hyperventilation should be avoided."

Findings may be crossed (some findings on one side of the body, some on the other).\n\u2022 Tenecteplase (TNK) is a thrombolytic (clot dissolving) medication used to treat a stroke. Unlike tPA which requires two separate doses infused over the course of an hour, TNK is a single dose administration. TNK is similar to tPA as they both activate plasminogen in the blood to dissolve clots that block the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain. However, TNK has a higher affinity for fibrin than tPA, which may promote a quicker dissolving of clots and opening of blood vessels."

Suction the nasopharynx and oropharynx as needed.\nPlace the patient in an extreme knee chest position (McRoberts maneuver) and apply gentle suprapubic pressure with an open hand.\nIf the above method is unsuccessful, consider rolling the patient from her existing position to the all-fours position. Often, the shoulder will dislodge during the act of turning, so that this movement alone may be sufficient to dislodge the impaction. In addition, once the position change is completed, gravitational forces may aid in the disimpaction of the fetal shoulders.\n\u2022 For malpresentation (breech) delivery: Transport unless delivery is imminent. Support presenting parts (never attempt to pull the presenting parts). If the legs have delivered, gently elevate the trunk and legs to aid delivery of the head. If the head is not delivered within 30 seconds of the legs, place two fingers into the vagina to locate the infant\u2019s mouth.

Less commonly, shoulder dystocia results from impaction of the posterior shoulder on the sacral promontory.\n\u2022 Placental abruption may present with mild, dark vaginal bleeding with abdominal pain/ uterine tenderness to massive hemorrhage and fetal demise. Because hemorrhage may occur into the abdominal/pelvic cavity, shock can develop despite relatively little visible (vaginal) bleeding.\n\u2022 Placenta previa is usually associated with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding and a non- . tender, soft uterus. Unlike the case with abruption, placenta previa related hemorrhage passes through the vaginal outlet and is not occult.\n\u2022 Maternal hypotension is defined as a SBP < 100 or < 80% of baseline.\n\u2022 Maternal hypotension can result in decreased placental perfusion.\n\u2022 In the setting of pregnancy, HTN is defined as a SBP > 140 or a DBP > 90, or a relative increase of 30 systolic and 20 diastolic from the patient\u2019s normal (pre-pregnancy) BP.\n\u2022 Severe headache, visual changes, edema, or RUQ pain may indicate preeclampsia.\n\u2022 Eclamptic seizures may occur up to two months post-partum.\n\u2022 For the pregnant patient in cardiopulmonary arrest, best outcomes for the mother and the fetus are achieved by aggressive maternal resuscitation and rapid transport with high quality CPR for possible peri-mortem Caesarean delivery.\n\u2022 Perform high quality CPR and follow appropriate Cardiac Arrest Protocols.\n\u2022 The most common causes of maternal cardiopulmonary arrest are hemorrhage, cardiovascular disease (MI, aortic dissection, myocarditis), pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, eclampsia and sepsis.\n\u2022 Aortocaval compression can occur at 20 weeks gestation.\n\u2022 At 20 weeks gestation the fundus is palpable at or above the umbilicus."

Consider per- forming a right sided ECG in patients with ECG findings suggestive of inferior wall STEMI.\n\u2022 The following are suggestive of RVI: STE in V , STE in lead III > lead II, STE in V R.\n\u2022 STE in V R has a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 78% and diagnostic accuracy of 83% in the diagnosis of RVI.\n\u2022 Patients with RVI are very preload sensitive and can develop severe hypotension in response to nitrates or other preload-reducing agents. If hypotension develops following the admin- istration of NTG, stop NTG administration and treat hypotension with an IV fluid bolus. NTG should not be used in patients with RV infarction.\n\u2022 NTG should not be administered to patients who have used sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio) or var- denafil (Levitra) in the past 24 hours or tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) in the past 36 hours. Revatio is prescribed for pulmonary hypertension.\n\u2022 Unless there is a known history of coronary disease, NTG should not be administered to pa- tients < 16 y.o. without consultation of medical control."

If no bystander care is in progress, begin CPR following current AHA ECC Guidelines.\n\u2022 A defibrillator (AED or manual) should be applied as soon as available and ECG rhythm analysis should immediately follow. If indicated (VF/VT), electrical therapy should be delivered without delay. The initial shock should be delivered at the defibrillator manufacture\u2019s recommended energy dose. Subsequent shocks should be administered as indicated every 2 minutes, interposed between two minute CPR duty cycles.\n\u2022 Continuous compressions and delivery of electrical therapy should take priority over other care.\n\u2022 Maintain good quality continuous compressions by switching healthcare professionals every 2 minutes. Rhythm checks should occur at this time and pauses should be limited to \u2264 5 seconds.\n\u2022 Pre-charge the defibrillator at 1:45 seconds of each duty cycle to minimize pre- shock pauses if electrical therapy is indicated.\n\u2022 CPR should be resumed immediately following the delivery of electrical therapy . without a pulse check.\n\u2022 If an automated CPR device (load-distributing or piston) is used, the time for application should be minimized.\n\u2022 Continuous inline waveform capnography may be helpful in determining the quality of chest compressions identifying return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\n\u2022 If the EtCO is < 10 mmHg, attempt to improve CPR quality.\n\u2022 For patients with shockable rhythm (VF/VT), the first 4 cycles of CPR should include passive ventilation with a non-rebreather mask or BVM. Subsequently, avoid over-ventilation; ventilate at a rate of 10 bpm. Advanced airway management should not occur until after the 4th cycle of CPR and should not result in interruption of chest compressions.\n\u2022 For patients with non-shockable rhythm (no shock advised), initiate airway management and artificial ventilation as soon as possible while providing continuous compressions and prompt epinephrine every 5 minutes to maximum of 5 doses. (NOTE: epinephrine administration for Advanced EMT,\nAdvanced EMT-Cardiac and Paramedic level ONLY).\n\u2022 A blindly inserted airway device (BIAD) [e.g., i-Gel\u00ae, King\u00ae airway, laryngeal mask airway, etc.) shall be the initial advanced airway of choice in all patients in cardiac arrest. The use of continuous waveform capnography confirming advanced airway placement is MANDATORY and must be monitored and documented.\n\u2022 Regardless of proximity to a receiving facility, absent concern for EMS healthcare professional\u2019s safety, confirmed pregnancy >20 weeks gestation or traumatic etiology for cardiac arrest, continue resuscitative efforts for a minimum of minutes prior to moving the patient to the ambulance or transporting the patient. BLS EMS healthcare professionals should request ALS, if available.\n\u2022 If, after 30 minutes of resuscitation at the scene, the patient has organized electrical activity or a shockable rhythm or an EtCO \u2265 20 mmHg or signs of life (purposeful motor movement, eye opening) during CPR, consideration should be given to continuing resuscitative efforts at the scene.\n\u2022 If return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, manage patient per age appropriate Post Cardiac Arrest Care Protocol.\n\u2022 Transport the patient to the nearest appropriate Hospital Emergency Facility. Per the Post Cardiac Arrest Care Protocol, patients with STEMI or hemodynamic instability (MAP <65 or SBP <90, electrical instability (recurrent VF/VT, bradycardia recurring with TCP or pharmacologic therapy) should be transported to PCI capable facility (see Routine Patient Care Protocol - Table 2 - Point of Entry - Specialized Hospital Emergency Facilities).\n\u2022 Identify possible treatable etiology of cardiac arrest and manage per appropriate r protocol(s) as indicated. Hypovolemia Tension pneumothorax Hypoxia Tamponade (cardiac) Hydrogen ion (acidosis) Toxins Hypothermia Thrombosis (pulmonary embolism) Hypokalemia / Hyperkalemia Thrombosis (coronary) .\n\u2022 Consider early IV placement (preferred) in a site above the diaphragm. If attempts at IV access are unsuccessful or not feasible, IO access (if available) may be attempted, preferably using a site above the diaphragm in age-appropriate patients (adolescents [age => 12] and adults).\n\u2022 For non-shockable rhythms, administer EPINEPHRINE (1 mg/10 ml) 1 mg IV/IO every 5 minutes to a maximum of 5 doses.\n\u2022 For non-shockable rhythms, administer LACTATED RINGER\u2019S or NORMAL SALINE 500\n-1000 ml IV/IO (may repeat x1).\n\u2022 Orotracheal intubation shall only be performed if the use a BIAD is insufficient to i facilitate adequate ventilation. In cardiac arrest, studies indicate that orotracheal r intubation offers no appreciable benefit to patient outcome when a BIAD is providing adequate ventilation. Additionally, interruptions in the delivery of chest compressions during attempts at orotracheal intubation may be harmful.\n\u2022 Consider early IV placement (preferred) in a site above the diaphragm. If attempts at IV access are unsuccessful or not feasible, IO access (if available) may be attempted, preferably using a site above the diaphragm in age-appropriate patients (adolescents [age => 12] and adults).\n\u2022 For non-shockable rhythms, administer EPINEPHRINE (1 mg/10 ml) 1 mg IV/IO every 5 minutes, to a maximum of 5 doses.\nFor ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT):\nC \u20dd\nElectrical therapy followed by a first dose of AMIODARONE or LIDOCAINE.\nAMIODARONE 300 mg IV/IO, repeat one additional dose of 150 mg for VF/VT refractory to an additional defibrillation attempt.\nContinue CPR and administer EPINEPHRINE (1mg/10 ml) IV/IO every 5 minutes to maximum of 3 doses.\nAs an alternative to amiodarone, or for VF/VT refractory to amiodarone, LIDOCAINE\n100 mg IV/IO, repeat every 10 minutes x2.\n\u2022 For refractory VF/VT:\nChange defibrillator pads and apply second set of pads at a new site.\nConsider Double Sequential External Defibrillation Procedure if resources allow.\n\u2022 For non-shockable rhythms and suspected hypovolemia, LACTATED RINGER\u2019S or NORMAL SALINE 500-1000 ml IV/IO (may repeat x1).\n\u2022 Orotracheal intubation shall only be performed if the use a BIAD is insufficient to facilitate adequate ventilation.

Consider EPINEPHRINE by IV infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min in place of EPINEPHRINE by IV bolus.\n\u2022 For recurrent VF/VT: i\nPROCAINAMIDE 1.5 gm IV infused over 15 minutes.\nMETOPROLOL 5 mg IV over 1 minute (may repeat every 5 minutes x3).\n\u2022 For refractory VF/VT:\nChange defibrillator pads and apply a 2nd set of pads to a new site.\nPROCAINAMIDE 1.5 gm IV infused over 15 minutes.\nMETOPROLOL 5 mg IV over 1 minute (may repeat every 5 minutes x3).\nConsider Double Sequential External Defibrillation Procedure Protocol if resources allow.\n\u2022 For pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest: l LACTATED RINGER\u2019S or NORMAL SALINE 500-1000 ml IV (may repeat x1).\nPerform needle thoracostomy for suspected tension pneumothorax.\n\u2022 For polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes) or suspected . hypomagnesemia, MAGNESIUM SULFATE 2 gm IV.\n\u2022 For patients with CPR induced consciousness, consider KETAMINE 0.5-1 mg/kg IV or MIDAZOLAM 5mg IV (may repeat every 5-10 minutes as required up to 20mg).\n\u2022 Consider placement of a gastric tube to address gastric distention.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 The focus of resuscitative efforts should be centered on high quality and continuous chest compressions (rate, depth, recoil) with limited interruptions. \u201cHands on chest time\u201d should be maximized. Peri-shock pauses should minimized. CPR should not be interrupted for placement of a BIAD or endotracheal intubation.\n\u2022 Absent a traumatic etiology, confirmed pregnancy >20 weeks gestation, or concerns for EMS healthcare professional safety, continue resuscitative efforts at the scene of the cardiac ar- rest for a period of not less than 30 minutes. Unless for environmental conditions, the patient should not be moved to the ambulance during this time (a definitive airway is not required as long as oxygen delivery and ventilation are achievable utilizing a bag-valve-mask device).\n\u2022 Prompt peri-mortem C-section is beneficial to both mother and baby, and therefore prompt transport with high quality CPR is recommended.\n\u2022 Some evidence suggests that in non-shockable rhythms, epinephrine is most beneficial when administered very early in cardiac arrest, and there is minimal benefit after 5 doses.\n\u2022 Attention should be paid to the ventilation rate. Do not hyperventilate, ventilation should occur at a rate of 10 bpm, EtCO should be used to guide ventilation.\n\u2022 In one study, pre-shock pauses >20 seconds had a 53% lower chance of survival compared to those with pre-shock pauses less than 10 seconds. For every 5 second increase in shock i pause, the chance of survival decreased by 18%. r\n\u2022 Consider possible treatable causes for cardiac arrest. Use relevant protocols in conjunction with this protocol when indicated.\n\u2022 Naloxone has no utility in cardiac arrest, even if secondary to opioid ingestion/overdose. Naloxone reverses respiratory depression, but during CPR respiration is artificially support- ed.\n\u2022 For patients with VF/PVT, antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, lidocaine) should be adminis- tered after at least one attempt at defibrillation.\n\u2022 Recurrent VF/VT is defined as VF/VT successfully terminated by conventional electrical ther- apy, but subsequently returns. It should be treated with conventional electrical therapy and antiarrhythmics.\n\u2022 Refractory VF/VT is not responsive to conventional electrical therapy. It should be treated with conventional electrical therapy, antiarrhythmics and, if resources allow, DSED. In pa- . tients with refractory VF/VT, consider replacing defibrillator pads and changing their loca- tion.\n\u2022 New evidence suggests some uncertainty about the efficacy of the IO route compared with IV. Therefore, it is reasonable for practitioners to first attempt establishing iv access for drug administration in cardiac arrest. Additionally, there is strong evidence that IV or IO access above the diaphragm, when possible, is preferable during cardiac arrest. References Goto Y, Funada A.

If the device is a pulsatile flow device, a blood pressure should be measurable. t Data suggest that pulse oximetry readings seem to be accurate, despite the i manufacturer stating otherwise.\nQuantitative waveform capnography should be accurate and can be reflective of pump function (cardiac output). An EtCO 2 of < 30 mmHg can be indicative of low l perfusion secondary to poor pump function.\nTemperature should be measured as infection and sepsis are common in VAD i patients.\n\u2022 Assess the VAD:\nE Auscultate over the VAD pump location (this should be just to the left of the epigastrium, immediately below the base of the heart). If the pump is functioning, a low hum should be audible. Do not assume that the pump is i functioning just because the control unit looks ok.\nPalpate the control unit. A hot control unit indicates the pump may be working harder than it should be and often indicates a pump problem such as a ti thrombosis.\nLook at the alarms on the control panel. Trouble with the VAD will usually be identified by an alarm. The patient will usually have a resource guide to direct alarm troubleshooting.\nThe patient and family members are generally very knowledgeable about the VAD and troubleshooting problems. Inquire about DNR status. Ask if the device is a continuous or pulsatile flow device. Ask if the patient can receive electrical therapy. Ask if chest compressions can be performed in the event of pump failure.\n\u2022 If there is no indication of possible VAD malfunction or failure, exit to appropriate protocols. Only symptomatic dysrhythmias that are not the patient\u2019s baseline should be treated. If indicated, place electrical therapy/defibrillation pads away from VAD site and AICD. Call the VAD coordinator and discuss plan with caregivers.\n\u2022 If the device is a pulsatile flow device and there is no palpable pulse or detectable blood pressure, the EMS healthcare professional should use the device\u2019s hand pump to maintain perfusion (family members should be familiar with this).\n\u2022 If there is indication of possible device malfunction or failure, contact the VAD coordinator. Discuss the plan with caregivers.\n\u2022 In the event the patient is unresponsive, has no signs of life, and has non-functioning pump, deciding when to initiate chest compressions is very difficult. Chest compressions may cause death by exsanguination if the device becomes dislodged. However, if the pump has stopped, the native heart will not be able to maintain perfusion and the patient will likely die. If a VAD patient is unresponsive with no signs of life, has a non-functioning VAD and has previously indicated a desire for resuscitative efforts, begin chest compressions and resuscitative efforts. Ensure that all troubleshooting efforts (reconnecting wires, changing batteries, replacing the control unit) have failed prior to starting chest compressions. Contact the VAD Coordinator and MEDICAL CONTROL.\n\u2022 When transporting a VAD patient: )\nPatients without a VAD problem should be transported to the nearest appropriate Hospital Emergency Facility for their condition.\n(\nPatients with a VAD problem should be transported to their VAD hospital\n\u25cb when possible. EMS healthcare professionals can utilize available resources c (private service, etc.) to facilitate transportation to the patient\u2019s VAD hospital.\nAlways bring the patient\u2019s resource bag with you. It should contain spare batteries, +/- a spare control unit, contact information for the VAD\nE coordinator, and directions for equipment and alarm troubleshooting. i\nAlways bring spare batteries for the VAD with the patient, even if it is not a VAD related problem. Fresh batteries last 3-5 hours.\nIf the transport is going to be prolonged or it is expected that the patient will\n\u25cb l be away for a while, try to bring the VAD base power unit with you.\nAlternately, you can ask the patient\u2019s family/caregiver to bring it to the i hospital. There may be times when you may need to bring it in the ambulance with the patient and plug it into an inverter to utilize it.\nti\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Utilize the patient and family as a resource.\n\u2022 Always contact the VAD coordinator if there is a VAD related problem or question.\n\u2022 Common complications in VAD patients include CVA and TIA (incidence up to 25%), bleeding, dysrhythmias, and infection.\n\u2022 The most common causes of death in VAD patients are sepsis and CVA. Keep these in mind when evaluating a VAD patient with altered mental status.\n\u2022 VAD patients are preload dependent. Consider that a fluid bolus can often reverse hypoperfusion.\nRecommended Resource/Reading:\nMechanical Circulatory Support Organization (MCSO), EMS Guide, January 2016."

Prior to t moving any patient, observe for indications (presence of wires, lying on top of package/backpack) that he/she is not connected to a secondary device.\n\u2022 Primary blast injuries are produced by contact of the blast shockwave with the body. This results in stress and shear waves within tissues. Gas filled organs (colon, lungs, ears) are at particular risk. Common primary injuries include blast lung injury, bowel perforation, splenic/hepatic rupture, tympanic membrane rupture, ocular injuries, and concussion (concussion may be present without overt signs of head injury).\n\u2022 Secondary blast injuries are produced by primary fragments (pieces of exploding weapon, e.g., nails, ball bearings) and secondary fragments (environmental fragments, e.g., glass). Common secondary injuries include penetrating injuries, traumatic amputations, and lacerations.\n\u2022 Tertiary blast injuries occur when the blast wave propels individuals onto surfaces/ objects or objects onto individuals.

Post-intubation management: ti a. Provide standard management for the patient with an advanced airway in place. Continuous quantitative capnography is mandatory. i b. Provide analgesia, sedation and neuromuscular blockade as indicated\n(remember, the effects of rocuronium remain for 30-60 minutes, paralysis without sedation must be avoided).\nc. When ventilating a patient post intubation, maintain the pre-intubation respiratory rate if it was high as it is most likely compensation for metabolic acidosis.\nd. Be prepared for post intubation hypotension and maintain hemodynamics with .\nIV fluids and vasopressors as needed.\ne. Perform gastric decompression by placing a gastric tube.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Execution of this protocol is restricted to Paramedics who have completed the prerequisite CEMS and EMS agency Medical Director competency requirements.\n\u2022 When a BVM is used for preoxygenating a spontaneously breathing patient (i.e., no positive pressure breaths), the BVM must contain a one-way exhalation valve and reservoir bag and the supplemental oxygen flow must be sufficient to match the patients minute ventilation.\n\u2022 Use of a sedating agent alone to facilitate intubation is considerably less desirable than utilizing a sedating agent in combination with a neuromuscular blocking agent. First attempt success rates are significantly increased utilizing a neuromuscular blocking\n) agent. l\n\u2022 In the pre-arrest patient, a \u201ccrash sequence\u201d utilizing only succinylcholine or c Rocuronium may be indicated. These situations are extremely rare and subsequent sedation must be provided when hemodynamically permissible.\n\u2022 Hemodynamic optimization with fluids and vasopressors should occur prior to intubation. Preload dependent patients (i.e., history of asthma) and others sensitive to positive pressure ventilation should be volume loaded prior to the institution of positive pressure ventilation. i\n\u2022 MAI includes rapid sequence intubation (the nearly simultaneous administration of a sedating agent and a short acting neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate intubation) and delayed sequence intubation (procedural sedation with the procedure being preoxygenation).\n\u2022 Contraindications to succinylcholine include a patient or family history of malignant i hyperthermia, burns, major crush injury injuries, denervation (spinal cord injury or CVA with paralysis) >24 hrs. (for the purposes of this protocol), myopathy, and preexisting hyperkalemia.\n\u2022 The onset of action and duration of action of succinylcholine is 45 seconds and 6-10 ( minutes respectively. The onset of action and duration of action of rocuronium is 60-90 seconds and 30-60 minutes respectively.\nti\n\u2022 Underdosing of rocuronium may result if the drug is administered based upon ideal, rather than actual body weights. For obese patients, rocuronium dosing should be based upon actual body weight.\n\u2022 The onset of action and duration of action of etomidate is 15-45 seconds and 3-12 minutes respectively. The onset of action and duration of action of ketamine is 45-60 seconds and 10-20 minutes respectively.\n\u2022 In both adults and pediatric patients, a repeat dose of succinylcholine may result in bradycardia requiring the administration of atropine sulfate.\n\u2022 There is concern in the literature that etomidate may inhibit endogenous cortisol production secondary due to inhibition of 11-\u03b2-hydroxylase in the adrenal cortex. While there has been no large, randomized, prospective, adequately powered study ti that has demonstrated a significant negative effect associated with the administration of etomidate in the setting of sepsis, some healthcare professionals avoid the use of i etomidate in this setting.\n\u2022 Very rarely the administration of succinylcholine may result in isolated masseter spasm causing mandibular rigidity (trismus) with limb muscle flaccidity. If this occurs and interferes with intubation, a non-depolarizing agents (rocuronium 1 mg/kg) should be . administered. The patient may require bag mask ventilation until complete muscle relaxation occurs.\n\u2022 Fasciculations following the administration of succinylcholine are generally of no clinical significance.\n\u2022 If hypotension ensues following the administration of ketamine, address the blood pressure prior to administering a paralytic."

Conventional surgical cricothyrotomy entails surgically providing an opening in the cricothyroid membrane for placement of an artificial airway. A variation of this technique, the endotracheal tube introducer [ETTI] (\u201cBougie\u201d) assisted technique, utilizes an ETTI in a method similar to the Seldinger technique to introduce an ETT through the cricothyroid membrane via a surgical incision. The percutaneous dilatational technique introduces an airway catheter into the cricothyroid membrane space over a guidewire and dilator (Seldinger technique). Finally, needle cricothyrotomy utilizes a catheter inserted over a needle into the cricothyroid space to provide transtracheal ventilation. Needle cricothyrotomy is reserved for patients < 12 y.o. and is considered a temporary means of airway access. The ability to provide adequate ventilation via a needle cricothyrotomy is limited.\nProcedure:\nConventional Surgical Technique\n1. Position the patient in a supine position with the head in a neutral position.\n2. Identify and palpate the thyroid cartilage, cricoid membrane, and cricoid - cartilage.\n3. Prepare the area over the cricothyroid membrane with alcohol or\nP chlorohexidine.\n4. Stabilize the thyroid cartilage with thumb and index finger with the non- dominant hand.\n5. Identify the cricothyroid membrane with the index finger of the non-dominant hand.\n6. Utilizing a scalpel with a #11 blade, poke the membrane to make an incision across the lower 1/3 of the cricothyroid membrane.\n7. Insert the left finger into the cricothyroid space to re-identify the membrane and the incision.\n8. Insert a tracheal hook (if available) into the incision (the hook should be held at a right angle to the patient\u2019s neck and directed into the incision using the index finger. Once the hook is located in the airway, rotate the hook in a cephalad direction and hold it at a 45\u00b0 angle.\n9. Insert a Trousseau dilator or curved hemostat into the incision and gently spread the incision to increase the vertical diameter of the membrane incision.\n10. Insert a #4.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube or a #6.0 endotracheal tube.\n11. Remove the obturator if a tracheostomy tube was used.\n12. Inflate the device cuff with appropriate volume of air.\n13. Confirm proper placement of the airway device utilizing standard methods\n(presence of breath sounds, absence of gastric sounds) and quantitative waveform capnography (a colorimetric EtCO device may be used for initial confirmation of placement if waveform capnography is not immediately available).\n14. Secure the airway device in place and provide standard care for the intubated patient.\n\u201cBouige\u201d Assisted Cricothyrotomy Technique\n1. Position the patient in a supine position with the head in a neutral position.\n2. Identify and palpate the thyroid cartilage, cricoid membrane, and cricoid cartilage.\n3. Prepare the area over the cricothyroid membrane with alcohol or chlorohexidine.\n4. Standing on the patients left side, stabilize the larynx with the thumb and index finger of your left hand and identify the cricothyroid membrane.\n5. Using a scalpel with a #20 blade make a stabbing incision through the skin and cricothyroid membrane.\n6. Place a tracheal hook at the inferior margin of the incision and gently pull up on the trachea.\n7. Insert an endotracheal tube introducer (ETTI, \u201cBougie\u201d) through the incision in caudal direction.\n8. Place a 6.0 cuffed endotracheal tube over the ETTI and into the trachea.\n9.

Prepare the area over the cricothyroid membrane with alcohol or chlorohexidine\n4. Utilizing a scalpel with a #15 blade, make a 2-3 cm midline vertical incision over the cricothyroid membrane.\n5. With a syringe attached, advance the introducer needle and catheter through the incision and into the airway at a 45\u00b0 angle to the frontal plane in the midline in a caudal direction.\n6. Aspirate with the attached syringe to confirm proper placement of the needle and introducer by the aspiration of free air.\n7. Once proper placement has been confirmed, remove the needle while leaving the introducer catheter in place.\n8. Advance the airway access assembly (with dilator inserted) over the guidewire until the proximal stiff end of the guidewire is completely through and visible at the handle end of the dilator.\n9. Remove the guidewire and dilator simultaneously.\n10. Inflate the airway cuff with 5-10 ml of air.\n11.

Stabilize the larynx with thumb and middle finger with the non-dominant hand.\n3. Utilizing the Cric-Knife incise the skin making a vertical incision from the mid- thyroid cartilage to the cricoid cartilage (about 2 finger breadths in length).\nlonger incision may be needed if the patient has a thick neck. If landmarks are clearly visible, a horizontal incision may be used.\n4. After palpating the cricothyroid membrane, turn the Cric-Knife to a horizontal position over the cricothyroid membrane.\n5. Push the blade downward, perpendicular to the trachea, until the blade is fully inserted and the airway is entered.\n6. While maintaining a downward force, slide the tracheal hook down the handle with your thumb until the hook is felt to enter the trachea, and disengages from the handle.\n7. Grab the hook with the non-dominant hand, lifting up on the thyroid cartilage.\n8. Insert the Cric-Key through the incision. Placement can be confirmed by moving the device along the anterior wall of the trachea to feel for the tracheal rings. Tenting of the skin, difficulty advancing the Cric-Key or lack of tactile feedback from the tracheal rings suggests incorrect placement.\n9. Once placement has been confirmed, advance the Cric-Key to the flange.\nStabilize the Cric-Key tube and pivot the tracheal hook toward the patient\u2019s shoulder to remove from the airway.\n10.

Confirm proper placement of the airway device utilizing standard methods\n(presence of breath sounds, absence of gastric sounds) and quantitative r waveform capnography (a colorimetric EtCO device may be used for initial\nP confirmation of placement if waveform ca 2 pnography is not immediately available).\n12. Secure the device with the stabilizing strap and airway device in place and provide standard care for the intubated patient.\nNeedle Cricothyrotomy\n1. Position the patient in a supine position with the head in a neutral position.\n2. Identify and palpate the thyroid cartilage, cricoid membrane, and cricoid cartilage.\n3. Prepare the area over the cricothyroid membrane with alcohol or chlorohexidine.\n4. Attach a 10ml syringe to a transtracheal catheter (preferred) or a 14-16g catheter over the needle device.\n5. Advance a transtracheal catheter/or catheter needle over the device in a caudal direction through the cricothyroid membrane and into the trachea. Be cautious to avoid penetrating the posterior trachea. .\n6. Remove the needle from the transtracheal airway catheter/catheter over the needle device.\n7. Attach a high pressure (50 psi) ventilation device (patients < 5 yo should be ventilated with a bag-valve-mask device) to the proximal end of the airway catheter and ventilate the patient while observing for chest rise and auscultating breath sounds.\n8. Continue ventilating while manually stabilizing the airway catheter, provide ventilations at a rate of 12-20 ventilations per minute with an I:E ratio of 1:2 or\n1:3 seconds. For patients <5 y.o., ventilate until chest rise is observed. For patients 5-12 y.o., ventilate at inspiratory pressures of 30-50 mmHg.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Being a low frequency procedure, EMS healthcare professionals should maintain familiarization with related anatomy and the technical aspects of performing cricothyrotomy on at least a yearly basis. This can be achieved by the use of cadaveric or other anatomic models and skills trainers.\n\u2022 The most common errors in performing cricothyrotomy are related to inaccurate landmarking and therefore, inaccurate incision.\n\u2022 The SHORT mnemonic may be used for recalling factors potentially associated with\ndifficult cricothyrotomy:\nSurgery (history of neck surgery, presence of a surgical scar) Hematoma Obesity Radiation (history or evidence of XRT) Trauma (direct laryngeal trauma with displaced landmarks)\n\u2022 Incision is made through the inferior edge (lower 1/3) of the cricothyroid membrane due to the relatively cephalad location artery and vein, which run transversely near the top of the membrane.\n\u2022 In children, the cricothyroid membrane is disproportionately smaller because of greater overlap of the thyroid cartilage over the cricoid cartilage. For this reason, surgical cricothyrotomy is not recommended in patients 12 years of age or younger.\n\u2022 Needle cricothyrotomy is generally reserved for patients <12y.o. (not generally a r procedure to be performed on the adult patient).\n-\n\u2022 Use of a non-kinking wire-coiled transtracheal catheter jet ventilation catheter is preferred over a catheter over the needle intravenous catheter for needle cricothyrotomy.\n\u2022 A 35mm adapter from a 3.0 ETT will fit the luer lock connector of a transtracheal catheter or that of a catheter over the needle device."

In patients with asthma, establishing a PEFR baseline allows the EMS healthcare professional to assess the patient\u2019s response to bronchodilator therapy. When used in the management of acute asthma, measurement of the PEFR is taken pre and post bronchodilator therapy. The PEFR is usually measured three times in succession and the highest value of the three measurements is documented. Normal PEFR varies with height. Many asthmatics routinely measure their PEFR and can provide the EMS Healthcare Professional with their normal PEFR.

The colorimetric device is similar to litmus (pH) paper and is purple at baseline, turning lighter (yellow) in the presence of CO . The presence of CO generally indicates proper (tracheal, not esophageal) placement of an advanced airway. However, a i detector\u2019s indication may be incorrect if there is no exhaled CO from the lungs (e.g., in situations of circulatory arrest with no tissue perfusion), or if there is CO from the stomach (e.g., when carbonated beverages have been ingested). The presence of gastric acid, as from vomiting, may also result in color change despite esophageal ETT ti positioning (this \u201cfalse-positive\u201d color change will usually not vary with respiratory cycle). There are several manufactures of these devices. Reference in this protocol to t patient weight based patient selection (adult vs. pediatric) and color change\nE correlations to EtCO levels is specific to the Nellcor Easy Cap II\u00ae and Pedi-Cap CO \u00ae detection devices manufactured by Covidien. EMS healthcare professionals should reference the specifications of their service specific device of choice.\nProcedure:\n1. Select appropriate detector depending on patient size and weight (Easy-Cap\u00ae for patients 15 kg, Pedi-Cap\u00ae for patients \u22651-15 kg).\n2. Attach the detector device to the airway device (ETT or BIAD).\n3. Attach a bag-valve-device to the detector device.\n4. Deliver 6 ventilations of moderate tidal volume.\n5. After the delivery of 6 ventilations as above, observe the color in the indicator window on full-end expiration. If CO is detected, the purple indicator will change from PURPLE to TAN (0.5-2.0%) or YELLOW (2-5%). The color change should be phasic with the ventilator cycle. This cycling of the colorimetric device in the YELLOW range is an extremely reliable indicator of appropriate ETT placement. -\n6. If the results are not conclusive, and the correct anatomic location of the advanced airway cannot be confirmed with certainty by other means, the advanced airway should be removed.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Colorimetric EtCO devices are to be utilized for the initial confirmation of ETT placement only. Quantitative waveform capnography must be instituted as soon as possible and during transport.\n\u2022 Colorimetric EtCO detection devices are not reliable for confirming placement of nasally placed endotracheal tubes\n\u2022 Contamination of the detector with gastric contents, medication, or mucous may increase . resistance, alter color change, and affect ventilation. If the device becomes contaminated, it should be discarded and replaced.\n\u2022 The detector device has a useful life of about two hours and may be left in place for that period of time.\n\u2022 An adult detector device may be used for a pediatric patient for initial airway placement confirmation, but due concerns for increased dead space, it must not be left in place.\n\u2022 Due to the potential for increased airway resistance, do not use the pediatric device on patients \u226515 kg. Further, if an adult device is used in a pediatric patients, low tidal volumes may prevent color change even if ETT placement is correct (tracheal).\n\u2022 The colorimetric device is not a replacement for waveform capnography."

The capnograph provides information\n2 2 not only regarding pulmonary ventilatory function, but also indirect information regarding cardiac function and perfusion. In addition to confirming and monitoring airway placement, quantitative waveform capnography has many applications in the critically ill patient. Waveform capnography allows EMS healthcare professionals to monitor CPR quality, optimize chest compressions, detect return of spontaneous circulation during chest compressions, and assess cardiac output in patients with pulseless electrical activity. EtCO monitoring can be used to guide ventilation parameters and assess the severity of respiratory distress and ventilatory fatigue\nE (CO retention) in a number of pathological conditions and in patients receiving sedation and or narcotic analgesia. It is also useful in assessing the degree of circulatory failure in shock from any cause. Capnography can also be used as part of screening patients for DKA or sepsis. The EtCO 2 waveform provides information related to airway obstruction and bronchospasm.\nProcedure:\n1. Select age appropriate sampling line/sensor.\nti\n2. Attach sample line to the EtCO monitoring device, verify the EtCO display is on and functioning.\nti\n3. Attach the sampling line/sensor to the ETT, BIAD or oxygen delivery device in the spontaneously breathing patient without an artificial airway.\n4. After 6 breaths, note the EtCO level and waveform characteristics.\n5. In all patients with spontaneous circulation, an EtCO 2 of 20mmHg is anticipated -\n(35-45 mmHg in patients with normal cardiac and pulmonary function). In patients undergoing CPR, if the EtCO is <15 mmHg, the quality (rate, depth, recoil) of external chest compressions should be assessed. In the post- resuscitation patient, no effort should be made to lower EtCO by modification of the ventilation rate.\n6. Any loss of CO detection or waveform must be addressed immediately.\nConsider the following:\nApnea or loss of airway (tube dislodgement, esophageal placement, obstruction).\nCirculatory collapse (cardiac arrest, exsanguination, massive pulmonary embolism).\n\u25cb Equipment failure (disconnection from ventilation device, equipment . malfunction).\n7. Document the use of capnography. Serial EtCO levels should be documented with each set of vital signs.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 The three physiologic factors affecting the EtCO are metabolism, ventilation and cardiac output. If any two these factors remain constant, any change in the EtCO can be attributed to the third.\n\u2022 In cardiac arrest, the EtCO is reflective of cardiac output generated by external chest compressions."

When measured with the use of pulse oximetry, this measurement is referred to as the SpO . An oximeter is not able to differentiate between Hb which is saturated by oxygen (HbO ) vs. Hb which is saturated by carbon monoxide (HbCO) or methemoglobin (metHb). A CO oximeter must be used for this purpose. In general, normal oxygen saturation is 97-99%. Measurements below 92-94% suggest respiratory compromise of a hypoxic nature. Supplemental oxygen administration is usually not indicated if the SpO is \u2265 94%.\nProcedure:\n1. Select appropriate site for application of the oximetric sensor. Utilize a site recommended by the device manufacturer. Most sensors work on the fingers, toes or ear. If non-invasive blood pressure monitoring (NIBP) is also being utilized, consider placement of the sensor on an extremity other than the one being utilized for NIBP.\n2. Allow oximeter to register the saturation level.\n3. Verify pulse rate displayed by the oximeter with the patient\u2019s pulse.

If performing a one time (\u201cspot\u201d) measurement, the probe/sensor should be left in place for a few minutes as oxygen saturation can vary.\n5. Document the SpO every time vital signs are documented and in response to therapy to correct hypoxemia.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 If a probe/sensor is too large or small, the light emitting diode (LED) and the light detector might not line up and result in a false reading.\n\u2022 Patients with anemia have a reduced level of functional Hb, however this limited amount of functional Hb may be well saturated with oxygen, so the patient may have a normal SpO in . spite of having a reduced oxygen carrying capacity and potential hypoxia.\n\u2022 In patients with poor perfusion/vasoconstriction (shock) it may be difficult for the oximeter to pick up an adequate signal due to reduced pulsatile blood flow. Similarly, this may occur in the hypothermic patient.\n\u2022 Irregular cardiac rhythms or tachycardia may reduce the reliability of oximetric readings.\n\u2022 Some nail polish or prosthetic fingernails may interfere with the accuracy of oximetry. If possible, select a digit with an unpolished nail, rotate the probe 90 degrees so the light is shining through the finger sideways, consider another site, or utilize acetone to remove the nail polish.\n\u2022 Sometimes external light sources may cause inaccurate readings. If this is suspected, try covering the site with opaque material.\n\u2022 The presence of an arterial oximetric waveform may be useful in verifying the presence of mechanical capture during transcutaneous pacing.\n\u2022 The preferred probe/sensor application site for newborns immediately after birth is the right hand.

Services utilizing mechanical ventilators are responsible for validating the\n- competency of individual Paramedics in the use of the service specific ventilator(s) and in the management of the mechanically ventilated patient. Documentation of individual competency must be maintained by the service.\nProcedure:\nGeneral\n1. All ventilators must be able to meet the demands of the patient\u2019s condition, taking into consideration all settings and features described or stipulated by the sending facility.\n2. If Paramedics (non-CCT paramedic) encounter a patient receiving a non- conventional mode of ventilation (e.g., adaptive support ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, dual control modes, proportional assist ventilation, volume-assured pressure support, volume support, etc.) with other complex ventilator needs, or a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), .\narrangements should be made to have the patient transported by a critical care specialty transport team or to have a critical care practitioner familiar and experienced with the specific mode of ventilation/needs accompany the patient.\n3. Unless the transfer is time sensitive in nature (e.g., STEMI, aortic dissection, acute\nCVA, unstable trauma, etc.), patients should be on the transport ventilator for minutes prior to departure from the sending facility.\n4. If there is question of ventilator function or troubleshooting of unresolved alarms is required, the patient should be disconnected from the ventilator and manually ventilated until the problem/alarm is resolved.\n5. An appropriate size bag-valve-mask device, oropharyngeal airway, and ml syringe must be with the patient and immediately available at all times.\n6. The following should be documented (as applicable) in the PCR for all mechanically ventilated patients: mode of ventilation, set rate/total rate, FiO , positive inspiratory pressure (PIP), pressure support, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the plateau pressure (if measured).\n7. Ensure/calculate gas supply required for duration of transport and emergency reserve.\n8. Procedural steps below are as applicable to specific to the ventilator and mode be used.\nInitiating Mechanical Ventilation after Placement of an Advanced Airway by EMS\n(assumes use of volume controlled ventilation and assist control [AC] mode):\n1. Turn the ventilator on and allow it to self- test/cycle as required for the ventilator being utilized.\n2. Select AC mode.\n3. Set the desired tidal volume: 8 ml/kg (larger volumes may lead to ventilator ti induced lung injury). The predicted body weight (PBW) should be utilized for this calculation: Males = 50 + 2.3 [height (inches) - 60], Females = 45.5 + 2.3 l ti\n[height (inches) -60]. See included reference chart.\n4. Set the desired rate (generally 10-12 bpm).\n5. Set the desired FiO 2 (1.0 may be used initially, but it should be decreased as l soon as possible to the lowest level that maintains the SpO 2 of \u2265 94%, but <\n100%).\n6. Set the inspiratory time (generally 0.8-1.2 seconds for the adult patient).\n7. Set the level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 5 cmH O (physiologic\nPEEP). This may be increased if required.\n8. Attach the ventilator circuit to the advanced airway (be sure the capnography\n-\nP sample line remains in place).\n9. Observe the patient for chest excursion, auscultate breath sounds, and verify the presence of a capnography waveform.\n10. Set ventilator alarms:\n\u2022 High Pressure Alarm: 10 Points above baseline\n\u2022 Low Pressure Alarm: 10 Points below baseline\n\u2022 Low Minute Volume Alarm: 10 to 15% below baseline\n11. Observe vital signs, SpO /EtCO , adjust parameters as required. Assess the patient for tolerance and the ventilator system for proper function and adjust accordingly.\n12. Consider the need for sedation and analgesia.\nContinuing Mechanical Ventilation from a Sending Facility\n1. Confirm ventilator settings with sending facility staff.\n2. Turn the ventilator on and allow it to self-test/cycle as required for the ventilator being utilized.\n3. Select desired mode of ventilation.\n4. If the patient is receiving volume cycled ventilation, set the desired tidal volume as per sending facility setting.\n5. If the patient is receiving pressure controlled ventilation, set the inspiratory pressure as per the sending facility setting.\n6. Set the inspiratory time as per the sending facility setting (generally 0.8 to 1.0 seconds for the adult patient).\n7. Set the desired rate as per the sending facility setting.\n8. Set the desired FiO2 as per the sending facility sending setting.\n9. Set the level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) as per the sending facility setting.\n10. Set pressure support as per the sending facility setting (if applicable).\n11. Attach the ventilator circuit to the advanced airway (be sure the capnography sample line remains in place).\n12. Observe the patient for chest excursion, auscultate breath sounds, and verify the presence of a capnography waveform.\n13. If pressure controlled ventilation is being utilized, verify that exhaled tidal volumes are comparable to those achieved during mechanical ventilation by\nP the sending facility.\n14. Set ventilator alarms:\n\u2022 Volume ventilation: High pressure alarm: 10 Points above baseline Low pressure alarm: 10 Points below baseline Low minute volume alarm: 10 to 15% below baseline\n\u2022 Pressure ventilation: High pressure alarm: 5 Points above baseline Low pressure aarm: 5 Points below baseline Low minute volume alarm: 10 to 15% below baseline ti\n15. Observe vital signs, SpO 2 /EtCO 2 , adjust parameters as required. Assess the patient for tolerance and the ventilator system for proper function and adjust l ti accordingly.\n16. Consider need for sedation and ventilation.\nContinuing Non-invasive Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) Support\n1. Confirm ventilator settings with sending facility staff.\n2. Determine desired exhaled tidal volume (5-8 ml/kg ideal body weight).\n3. Determine appropriate mask size.\n4. Turn the ventilator on and allow it to self-test/cycle as required for the ventilator being utilized. -\n5. Set the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) as per the sending facility setting.\n6. Set the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) as per the sending facility setting.\n7. Set the FiO as per the sending facility setting.\n8. Set the desired backup rate.\n9. Connect the patient to the circuit. Adjust the head strap to minimize leaks at the patient-mask interface. Assess the patient for tolerance and the ventilator system for proper function and adjust accordingly.\n10. Observe the estimated exhaled tidal volume. This number should approximate the desired exhaled tidal volume as determined above. If the estimated exhaled tidal volume is not maintained close to the desired tidal volume, adjust the patient-unit interface as needed to achieve a steady estimated exhaled tidal volume.\n11. Set ventilator alarms as applicable (high pressure, low pressure, time delay, .\napnea, low minute volume, high rate).\n12. Observe vital signs, SpO /EtCO , adjust parameters as required. Assess the patient for tolerance and the ventilator system for proper function and adjust accordingly.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 High pressure alarm etiologies: kinking/obstruction of the ETT, increased airway resistance (bronchospasm, mucous plugging), decreased lung compliance (pulmonary edema, hyperinflation), decreased thoracic compliance (pneumothorax, gastric distension, abdominal compartment syndrome, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony).\n\u2022 Low pressure alarm etiologies: circuit disconnect, low ETT cuff pressure, or air leak from drainage and access ports.\n\u2022 Mandatory modes (AC or SIMV), assure a minimum respiratory rate and tidal volume.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Spontaneous modes (pressure-supported ventilation, or PSV) are dependent on patient effort. A minimum number of machine breaths are set by the operator and these are synchronized to the patient\u2019s respiratory effort. The patient may take additional breaths, but these will not be supported and could increase work of breathing.\n\u2022 AC provides full machine support (machine breath) for the programmed rate and for any additional patient-triggered breaths. Hyperventilation is possible.\n\u2022 Peak pressure is the sum of pressure required to overcome airway resistance and the pressure required to overcome elastic properties of the lung and chest wall. When an inspiratory hold is applied at the end of inspiration, gas flow ceases and the pressure drops to a measurement called the inspiratory plateau or plateau pressure.\n\u2022 The plateau pressure (Pplat) reflects the pressure required to overcome elastic recoil in ti the lung and the chest wall, and is the best estimate of peak alveolar pressure reflecting alveolar distention. l ti\n\u2022 A high Pplat (>30) can be due to excessive tidal volume, gas trapping, PEEP or low compliance. Pplat (alveolar pressure) = (volume/ compliance) + PEEP. The goal is to maintain the Pplat at <30 to decrease this risk of lung injury.\n\u2022 Optimal measurement of the Pplat requires the absence of patient effort. The Plat is estimated by determining the inspiratory pause pressure, which corresponds to the i plateau pressure. The inspiratory pause pressure is determined by activating the inspiratory pause hold function.\n\u2022 Strategies to reduce the Pplat include decreasing the tidal volume, decreasing extrinsic\nPEEP, and decreasing auto-PEEP (see below).\n-\n\u2022 Auto (intrinsic) PEEP results from incomplete expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath. This causes progressive air trapping (hyperinflation) and results in PEEP over and above the level set on the ventilator. This accumulation of air increases alveolar pressure at the end of expiration. Auto-PEEP decreases venous return and can cause hypotension and cardiac arrest (PEA).\n\u2022 Auto-PEEP can be measured using manual methods or through electronic functions in some ventilators. It is most easily identified by viewing the flow-versus-time graphic available on most ventilators, as the expiratory flow fails to reach the zero flow level before initiation of the next breath.\n\u2022 Auto-PEEP may be managed by increasing the expiratory time, decreasing the respiratory rate, decreasing the tidal volume, reducing ventilator demand (sedation, treating fever, pain, shivering), or adding external PEEP.\n\u2022 In bi-level positive airway pressure support, the difference between the EPAP and the IPAP (called the pressure support) augments ventilation and reduces the work of breathing. Increasing the difference between the IPAP and EPAP increases the level of pressure support provided. The difference between the two is adjusted to achieve and effective tidal volume and CO clearance. The EPAP may be adjusted in increments of 2 cmH O per step to improve oxygenation. A similar increase in the IPAP may be required to maintain the same tidal volume.\n\u2022 For patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, evaluate the patient for auto-PEEP and manage inspiratory time and expiratory time to reduce or eliminate auto-PEEP. Patients with obstructive pulmonary disease will require a longer expiratory time.\n\u2022 Asthmatics can be particularly sensitive to the hemodynamic effects of positive pressure ventilation and are at increased risk for developing auto-PEEP. Minimizing hyperinflation and avoiding excessive airway pressures are key goals in ventilating these patients. These goals are best accomplished by utilizing low respiratory rate and tidal volume to allow sufficient time for exhalation. Higher than normal CO levels should be tolerated in these patients.\nti ti\n-"

Many patients tolerate bradycardia (HR<60 in the adult) and experience no hemodynamic compromise, but some patients with profound bradycardia or those that are dependent on heart rate to maintain cardiac output may experience decreased cardiac or cerebral perfusion as a result of bradycardia. TCP is an option for treating\n) bradycardia when it associated with hemodynamic compromise (decreased perfusion). TCP is considered equivalent to pharmacotherapy (atropine sulfate) and\n( may be used immediately (in lieu of atropine sulfate) or in patients who do not respond to atropine sulfate. It should be noted that when there is impairment in the conduction system resulting in a high-degree block (e.g., Mobitz type II second- degree block or third-degree AV block), atropine sulfate is unlikely to be effective.\nProcedure:\n1. Explain procedure to patient if applicable.\n2. Attach ECG monitoring electrodes in the standard 4 lead configuration.\n3. Apply pacing/multifunction therapy pads. Anterior-Posterior (AP) application is preferred for pacing. In the AP configuration, one pad is placed to the anterior mid chest next to the sternum and another pad is placed to the mid left posterior chest next to the spine. Alternately, the Anterior-Lateral (AL)\nC configuration may be utilized. In the anterior-lateral configuration, the lateral r\n(apex) pad is placed on the left anterior chest, just lateral to the left nipple in - the midaxillary line and the anterior electrode is placed in the right sub-\nP clavicular area lateral to the sternum. r\n4. Select pacing function on the monitor unit.\n5. Set pacing rate to 70 bpm for an adult patient and 100 bpm for a pediatric patient.\n6. Note pacing spikes on the screen. Beginning at the lowest mA setting possible, gradually increase the current until electrical capture occurs. In most patients capture will be achieved with an output of 50-100 mA.\n7. Once electrical capture is achieved, check for corresponding mechanical capture as evidenced by a palpable pulse or presence of an oximetric (arterial) waveform.\n8.

To date there is no literature demonstrating outcomes related superiority of these devices when compared to manually performed CPR. The 2015 AHA Guidelines Update for CPR and ECC state \u201cThe use of LDB-CPR may be considered in specific settings where the delivery of high-quality manual compressions may be challenging or dangerous for the EMS healthcare professional (e.g., limited rescuers available, in a moving ambulance), provided that rescuers strictly limit interruptions in CPR during deployment and removal of the devices. The use of these devices are classified as a Class IIb recommendation\n(usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion). The procedure for the use of three common devices is detailed below. EMS healthcare professionals may utilize other FDA approved mechanical CPR devices. The validation and documentation of the individual EMS healthcare professional\u2019s competency utilizing a particular device is ultimately the responsibility of the service\u2019s Medical Director.\nProcedure:\nLUCAS\u00ae\n1. Ensure the operation knob is in the ADJUST position.\n-\n2. Assemble/prepare the device as per type being used (electric or pneumatic).\n3. At the time of the next 2 minute CPR duty cycle pause, apply a posterior electrical therapy/defibrillation pad and place the patient on a backboard.\n4. Place the back plate under the patient on backboard below the armpits.\n5. Resume chest compressions.\n6. Position the suction cup so the lower edge is immediately above the end of the sternum and the pressure pad is centered over the middle of the sternum.\n7. Lower the suction cup and pressure pad to the point where it is just comes into contact with the patient\u2019s lower chest. If the pad does not fit, resume manual chest compressions.\n8. Turn the operation knob to ACTIVE.\n9. Check the device for proper position. .\n10. Attach the stabilization straps.\n11. To stop LUCAS operation, turn the operation knob to LOCK (this should only be done if the device is improperly placed, injury to the patient is occurring, to assess the patient, or when an AED is analyzing and charging).\n12. If sustained return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, release and retract the\n\u201cpressure pad\u201d to allow for greater chest excursion and tidal volume during bag- valve-mask ventilation.\nAutoPulse\n1. Power on the AutoPulse platform and allow the device to initialize and perform the device self-test. Proceed only if the device indicates it is ready for use.\n2 At the time of the next 2 minute CPR duty cycle pause, sit the patient up and cut any clothing by making a single cut down the back.\n3. Slide the AutoPulse platform into position behind the sitting patient and lay the patient down onto the platform.\n4. Grasp any clothing that was cut by the sleeves and pull downward toward the ankles to remove all clothing from both the front and back of the torso.\n5. CPR may be resumed for a two minute duty cycle depending on the time expended thus far. If this is the case, resume deployment at the end of the duty cycle.\n6. Position the patient so that the patient is centered laterally (from left to right) and that the patient\u2019s armpits are aligned with the AuoPulse platform using the yellow line positioning guides on the AutoPulse platform.\n7. Align the chest bands. Place band-1 on top of the patient\u2019s chest, locate the mating slot of band-2 over the alignment tab. Press the bands together to engage and secure the Velcro fastener (make sure the bands are not twisted before automatic compressions begin, if the bands cannot be closed, use manual CPR).\n8. Make sure that the yellow upper edge of the chest bands are aligned with the patient\u2019s armpits, and that it is directly over the yellow line on the platform.\nThere should be no obstructions (clothing, straps, or equipment) with the bands.\n9. Press and release the START-CONTINUE button once (the AutoPulse will\nE automatically adjust the bands to the patient\u2019s chest).\n10. Verify the patient is properly aligned and that all slack in the bands has been\n- taken up.\n11. Press and release the START-CONTINUE button a second time. The AutoPulse r will begin automated compressions.\n12. The user has the option of switching between compressions delivered at 15:2 or continuous.\n13. Positive pressure ventilation can be performed synchronous with any decompression and or with the ventilation pause. Check the patient\u2019s chest rise during active operation.\n14. Compressions may be paused by pressing the STOP-CANCEL button, push RESUME to resume compressions.\n15. To turn the AutoPulse off, press the STOP-CANCEL button followed by the ON- OFF button. .\nROSC-U MCCR\n1. Ensure high quality manual chest compressions are ongoing.\n2. Prepare the unit for application.\n3. Ensure the main power switch on the battery control unit is in the ON position, which is indicated by it being illuminated.\n4. Prepare to apply the device at the time of the next anticipated pause.\n5. Roll the patient on to his/her side and slip the torso restraint under patient\u2019s back.\n6. Position the center of the compressor along an imaginary line connecting the nipples approximately 3-4 cm/1.2-1.6\u201d (1-2 fingers) from bottom of sternal notch.\n7. Wrap the torso restraint around patient and secure the compressor to the patient\u2019s body by firmly pulling fabric ends of the torso restraint fully out\n(creating tension) then down onto patient\u2019s chest.\n8. Verify that the device is properly positioned and secured on the patient.\n9. Turn the power ON using the main green power rocker switch (it will illuminate).\n10. Start compressions by pushing the red power button.\nE 11. If desired, adjust piston depth beyond default depth using the yellow piston depth set button.\n12. Pause/restart compressions by pushing the green run/pause button.\n13. When resuscitation efforts are terminated, push the red power ON/OFF button to stop compression cycles and then turn main ON/OFF power rocker i switch to the OFF position. Disconnect the torso restraint from the compressor. Remove the compressor from patient\u2019s chest.\n-\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Deployment or removal of external CPR devices should not significantly (>10 seconds) interrupt chest compressions.\n\u2022 System personnel should train with their respective devices to minimize deployment time and interruptions in chest compressions.\n\u2022 External CPR devices should never be left unattended or with an untrained Healthcare\nProfessional.\n\u2022 Healthcare Professional should be familiar with the specific device being utilized and should receive formal in-service training provided by their service specific to the device.\n\u2022 Mechanical CPR Device should not be used during a trauma code if the device cannot be secured properly or suction cup does not suction to chest due to the trauma.

Additionally, gastric intubation/decompression should be considered in patient at high risk for aspiration due to vomiting and those with burns affecting >20% body surface area. When possible (intubated patient usually), the oral route is preferred over the nasal route due to the risk for infection. In the intubated patient, gastric decompression is a part of airway management, as it decreases the risk for micro aspiration.

Push-dose vasopressors are used as a bridge to the institution of a vasopressor infusion or to ti treat acute hypotension related to medication administration. Some vasopressors are available in push-dose concentration prefilled syringes, but they have a very short shelf life. Because of this, EMS healthcare professionals are frequently required to dilute vasopressors to create the appropriate concentration of the medication for push-dose use in the field and critical care transport setting. It is imperative that the paramedic ensures that the appropriate concentration of medication is being administered. Syringes containing push-dose vasopressors must be labeled with the drug name and concentration.\nProcedure:\nEpinephrine The push dose concentration (10 mcg/ml) of epinephrine is normally created by diluting epinephrine 1 mg/10 ml [100 mcg/ml] (previously referred to as epinephrine\n1:10,000).\n- Onset of action: 1 minute Duration of action: 5-10 minutes\nAdult dose: 10-20 mcg every 3-5 minutes -\nPediatric dose: 1 mcg/kg (0.1 ml/kg) every 3-5 minutes\nThe create push-dose concentration (10 mcg/ml) epinephrine:\n1.

Label the syringe.\nIf there is a shortage of prefilled syringes containing epinephrine 1 mg/10ml, you will must first create epinephrine 1 mg/10ml prior to preceding with the above. To do\nthis:\n1. Draw up 1ml from a vial or ampule containing epinephrine 1 mg/ml (previously referred to as epinephrine 1:1,000) into a 10ml syringe.\n2.

You now have epinephrine 1 mg/10ml. .\nPhenylephrine The push-dose concentration (100 mcg/ml) of phenylephrine is created by diluting phenylephrine mg/ml.\nOnset of action: 1 minute Duration of action: 10-20 minutes\nAdult dose: 50-100 mcg every 2-5 minutes\nPediatric dose: 5 mcg/kg [maximum single dose 100 mcg] every 5-10 minutes\nThe create push-dose concentration (100 mcg/ml) phenylephrine:\n1. Draw up 1ml of phenylephrine from a vial containing phenylephrine 10mg/ml.\n2. Inject the 1ml (10mg) of phenylephrine into a 100 ml bag of 0.9% saline to create a concentration of 100 mcg/ml.\n3. Draw up 10ml from the bag into a 10ml syringe (you now have 100 mcg/ml in the syringe).\n4. Label the syringe.\nti\n-\n-\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Phenylephrine is a pure \u03b1 agent and it is devoid of any inotropic or positive chronotropic effects. Because profound \u03b1 stimulation can result in reflex bradycardia, phenylephrine should be avoided in the setting of hypotension with significant brady- cardia (use epinephrine instead).\n\u2022 Epinephrine is an \u03b1 and \u03b2 agonist, so it has positive inotropic, chronotropic and vasopressor properties at the dose utilized for push-dose administration."

The validation and documentation of the individual EMS healthcare professional\u2019s competency utilizing a particular device is\n- ultimately the responsibility of the service Medical Director. EMS healthcare professionals should follow the device manufactures recommendations for use and\nC locations for anatomic placement.\nProcedure:\n1. If possible, place the patient in a supine position.\nP 2. If applicable, explain the procedure to the patient.\n3. Select appropriate site as per specific device FDA approved insertion site(s).\nThese may include the proximal or distal tibia, the proximal humerus or the sternum.\n4. Identify bony and other anatomic landmarks specific to the selected insertion site.\n5. Prepare the site with alcohol or chlorhexidine.\n6. Insert the device manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedure.\n7. Confirm proper placement of the device following the device manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Generally, devices are properly placed if they stand without support and infused fluids do not infiltrate at the site. While the aspiration of bone marrow is confirmatory, the absence of bone marrow aspiration is inconclusive.\n8. If the patient is awake and alert, provide intramedullary anesthesia by slowly injecting 2% (cardiac) LIDOCAINE through the IO device. The dose for the adult patient is 20-50 mg and the dose for the pediatric patient is 0.5 mg/kg.\n9. Flush the device with 10 ml of normal saline prior to use.\n10. Stabilize the device utilizing a commercially available stabilization device or stabilize the needle on both sides with sterile dressings and secure with tape avoiding tension on the needle. Additional manual stabilization is recommended during resuscitation involving infants or small pediatric patients.\n11. Following the administration of medication, flush the device with 10 ml of IV fluid. For the continuous infusion of resuscitation fluids, a pressure infuser bag should be used. Vasopressors should be administered via an IV infusion pump.\n12. Document procedure, including size and type of device used, number of attempts, anatomic location, +/- use of anesthetic, and any complications.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 Intraosseous placement in cardiac arrest should not interfere with, or interrupt, chest compressions.\n)\n(\n-"

    "content": "Indication:\n\u2022 Patient with a life threatening condition or in extremis from a readily treatable etiology (e.g., pulmonary edema) requiring venous access when traditional means are unsuccessful or unavailable.\nContraindications:\nNone.\nBackground:\nSome patients requiring long term care may have alternate vascular access devices placed. These devices include centrally placed venous lines, peripherally inserted central line catheters (PICC line), internal subcutaneous infusion ports (portacath), hemodialysis AV fistulas and grafts, or tunneled catheters (Broviac\u00ae, Hickman\u00ae, Groshong\u00ae, Leonard\u00ae, etc.). In the event a patient with one of these devices is experiencing a life threatening condition or is in extremis from a readily treatable etiology (i.e., pulmonary edema) and venous access through traditional means is unsuccessful/unavailable, paramedics may access these devices.\nProcedure:\nCentrally Placed Venous Catheter (single or multi-lumen)\n1. Select a port to access. Fluids and medications administered via any of the ports r will end up in the same place (central venous circulation), so any available port l can be used for emergent fluid or medication administration. If there is a port reserved for total parental nutrition (TPN) only, it will usually be labeled as such and should be avoided if possible.\n2. Utilize good hand hygiene with either an alcohol based cleanser or soap and ti water.\n3. Cleanse the port with chlorohexidine.\nP 4. Using sterile technique, access the port with a 10 ml syringe and aspirate 5-10 r ml of blood. Detach the syringe and attach another syringe with 5-10 ml of normal saline and gently flush the port. If there is resistance, evidence of\n- infiltration, or any concern that the catheter may be clotted or dislodged, do not use the catheter.\n5. Remove the syringe, attach an IV administration set and proceed as normal, opening the line and insuring patency.\nPeripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) r\nPICC lines are usually inserted into the distal superior vena cava or the right atrium l via the antecubital vein.\n1. Utilize good hand hygiene with either an alcohol based cleanser or soap and water.\n2. Select a port on one of the catheters (if two sizes are available, select the larger of the two).\n3. Cleanse the port with chlorohexidine.\n4. Attach a 10 ml syringe with 5ml of normal saline drawn up into it to the selected port\u2019s needleless connector.\n5. Unclamp the selected catheter lumen (if applicable) and inject the normal saline .\ninto the port and then aspirate to achieve blood return, indicating successful access (if resistance is met, repeat on another port, if a port without resistance is not identified, do not use the device).\n6. Remove the syringe, attach an IV administration set and proceed as normal, opening the line and insuring patency.\nTunneled Catheters (Broviac\u00ae, Hickman\u00ae, Groshong\u00ae, Leonard\u00ae) Tunneled catheters are also inserted into the distal superior vena cava or the right atrium via the cephalic vein. These catheters enter the skin through an incision on the chest. Most of these devices are heparinized and protected with an injectable cap.\n1. Use good hand hygiene with either an alcohol based cleanser or soap and water.\n2. Select an appropriate port for access. If more than one is available, select the largest one (if they are color coded, select the blue or brown one).\n3. Clamp off the selected catheter. Expose the end of the hub (it may have a cap or be taped over) and cleanse it with chlorhexidine.\n4. Attach a 10 ml syringe to the selected port\u2019s needleless connector.\n5. With the syringe attached, unclamp the catheter and aspirate 5ml of blood and heparin (there should be no resistance to aspiration, if unable to aspirate, do not use the catheter).\n6. Detach the syringe and dispose of it properly in an approved sharps container.\n7. Without contaminating the needless connector, attach a second syringe with ml of normal saline and flush the catheter (the catheter should flush freely, if it does not, do not use the catheter).\n8. Remove the syringe, attach an IV administration set and proceed as normal, opening the line and insuring patency. i Internal Subcutaneous Infusion Ports (portacath)\n1. Utilize good hand hygiene with either an alcohol based cleanser or soap and water.\n2. Locate the port by visualization and palpation (sub-clavicular, dome shaped c prominence).\n3. Vigorously cleanse the site with chlorhexidine and allow the site to air dry.\n4. Attach a 10 ml syringe prefilled with normal saline to the infusion port cap of l the extension tubing of a non-coring, right angle (Huber) needle and prime the tubing and needle.\n5. Don a surgical mask and mask the patient, don sterile surgical gloves (if\nP available).\n6. Secure the access point port firmly between two fingers and firmly insert the ti non-coring needle into the port, entering at a 90\u00b0 angle.\n7. Aspirate 3-5 ml of blood with the syringe (if unable to aspirate blood, do not use the port), detach the syringe and dispose of the syringe and aspirated blood properly in an approved sharps container.\n8. Attach a 10 ml syringe prefilled with normal saline to the infusion port cap of - the extension tubing of the non-coring needle. Flush the device with 3-5 ml of normal saline (if the device does not flush easily, do not use the device).\n9. Remove the syringe, attach an IV administration set and proceed as normal, opening the line and insuring patency.\n10. Cover the needle and insertion site with a sterile occlusive dressing.\nAV Fistula or Graft (cardiac arrest and peri-arrest patients only)\n1. In the patient with spontaneous circulation, palpate the fistula for a thrill (i.e., a vibration felt over the fistula during systole, which indicates proper functioning) and document its presence.\n2. Apply a venous tourniquet proximal to the fistula site.\n3. Cleanse the site with chlorhexidine.\n4. Insert a 16-18g catheter-over-the needle device, needle or butterfly needle into the fistula at a 20-35\u00b0 angle (if accessing a graft, enter at a 45\u00b0 angle). Insert until blood return is observed. Once blood return is observed, insert the catheter or needle to the hub.\n5. Remove the venous tourniquet (if utilized).\n6. Secure the catheter or needle in place.\n7. Attach an IV administration set and proceed as normal, opening the line and insuring patency (blood flows through fistulas at high velocity and fluids may need to administered under pressure).\n8. Cover the needle and insertion site with a sterile occlusive dressing.\nNOTES:\n\u2022 PICC lines will not tolerate rapid infusions or infusions under pressure.\n\u2022 Avoid measuring a blood pressure in the same arm with a PICC inserted.\n\u2022 Do not exceed recommended flow rates. Device Size Maximum Flow Rate\nPICC < 2.0 fr 125 ml/hr\nPICC > 2.0 fr 250 ml/hr Groshong PICC 3 fr 240 ml/hr Grsohong PICC NXT 4 fr 540 ml/hr Groshong PICC NXT 5 fr 200 ml/hr Hickman/Broviac (Power Port) 8-9.5 fr 3000 ml/hr\n\u2022 AV fistulas are created surgically by creating an anastomosis between an artery and a vein. An AV fistula can usually be differentiated from an AV graft by the presence of two scars.\n\u2022 An AV graft is created surgically by connecting an artery and a vein together with a synthetic graft. An AV graft usually has only one scar associated with it.\n\u2022 The Groshong\u00ae catheter is very similar to the Hickman catheter, but has a valve at the tip of the catheter which makes it unnecessary to leave a high concentration of heparin in the catheter.\nti\n-"

Cannulation of the umbilical vein should be reserved for the unstable patient in which peripheral or intraosseous access is unavailable.\nProcedure:\nti\n1. Double wrap a piece of umbilical tape around the base of the cord.\n3. Utilize sterile technique (sterile gloves, mask, drapes) as much is possible.\n3. Prepare the cord stump and surrounding abdomen with betadine solution.\n4. If the stump is not fresh, cut the stump horizontally with a #15 scalpel approximately 1.5-2 cm from the abdominal wall.\n5. If there is bleeding, hemostasis can be achieved by applying gentle tension on the umbilical tape.\n6. Identify the umbilical vasculature. The two arteries are the thick-walled small vessels and the one thin-walled vessel is the vein. The umbilical vein (UV) is the largest of the three vessels and is usually located in the 12 o\u2019clock position.\n7. If present, utilizing forceps, gently remove and clots from the UV.\n8. Utilizing forceps, open and dilate the vein (the vein is usually open and will not require dilation).\n9. Insert an appropriately sized UV catheter (3.5fr for premature infants and 5fr - for full-term infants). The catheter should be inserted just to the point that blood returns (low line placement).\n10. Secure the catheter in place.\nNOTES: .\n\u2022 Advancing the catheter beyond the point at which blood is returned may result in placement of the catheter in the portal vein.\n\u2022 Portal vein placement should be suspected if resistance to advancement is met. If portal vein placement is suspected, withdraw the catheter to the appropriate point."
